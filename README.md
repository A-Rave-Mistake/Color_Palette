# About  
  
## Goal  
This app is supposed to be a small tool for artists and designers. When working inside graphics editing programs I've often catched myself switching back and forth between the editor and google in search of colors and shades. This becomes even messier when, like me, a person has 2 screens with one reserved for the editor and the second one for reference images. This app delivers the possibility to declutter the working space and give all-in-one tool pack just in reach of your mouse cursor.  
  
And so this app comes into play. It allows you to pick color and get the HEX or RGB value of it, see different color shades and create and save custom color palettes, all while this program stays on top of other software so you don't have to switch between windows.  

This program also allows you for quick export of the saved color palettes as .jpegs, which then you can load into editor and copy colors from. You can also generate color palette from a image, like drawing or photo or simply another color palette. If you see a color/shade you like, you can also copy it via eyedropper tool, from any website or app or image and get it's HEX value ora dd it to the palette.
